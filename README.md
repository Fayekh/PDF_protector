# PDF_protector
A minimal Python application crafted to add password protection to PDF files.

Put the pdf file's full location along with the name and extension. For example:
C:\Users\user\Documents\file.pdf

I will later change this thing with the "Choose file" option.

The new protected file will be saved in the root folder.
